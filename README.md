# haskell-build [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/irreverent-pixel-feats/haskell-ubuntu-xenial-build-8.0.2?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/irreverent-pixel-feats/haskell-ubuntu-xenial-build-8.0.2)

Docker images for a Haskell build environment

SHAs for tracking the build environment used to build your binaries can be found in
`/var/version`.

It differs from most other build images available on Docker in that it comes with
a pre-baked installation of [ambiata/mafia](https://github.org/ambiata/mafia) for those
who want an alternative to `stack`
